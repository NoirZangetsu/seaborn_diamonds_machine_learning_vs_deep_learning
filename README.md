# seaborn_diamonds_machine_learning_vs_deep_learning

In this code example, a dataset is preprocessed, modelled, and then the models are contrasted. We'll focus on the seaborn library's diamonds dataset specifically. The qualities and pricing of diamonds are included in this dataset. Our objective is to forecast diamond prices using various deep learning and machine learning methods.

The dataset must first be imported and investigated. In this stage, we examine the dataset's dimensions, statistics, and missing values. It also enables us to distinguish between qualities that are categorical and those that are numerical.

Next, we draw the histograms of the numerical variables to observe the variable distributions. This aids in our comprehension of the data's fundamental structure.

We may clear up abnormalities from our dataset by using the phase of outlier detection and removal. The Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm is used for this.

The category characteristics are then one-hot encoded into numeric format. This stage enables categorical data to be understood by machine learning and deep learning algorithms.

Scaling features is the following stage. This guarantees that all features have the same scale and is accomplished using StandardScaler.

Next, training and test sets are created from the data collection. This enables us to assess the model's performance using fresh data.

Next, predictions are produced using a deep learning model created with the TensorFlow library and a linear regression model trained using the Scikit-Learn library.

Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of the two models. To do this, we compute the mean square error (MSE) for each model and graph the results. This aids in identifying the model that outperforms the test set.

The steps of a whole data science project are demonstrated by this method. It should be emphasized, nevertheless, that because every dataset is different, each dataset can need its own unique set of data pretreatment methods.
